Download the dataset from here. There are two files, one for real news and one for fake news (both in English) with a total of 23481 “fake” tweets and 21417 “real” articles.

OBJECTIVE:
To analyze three different Machine Learning Classification algorithms / models on ‘Fake and real news’ dataset and select the model which gives us the highest performance to detect fake and real news.
•	Python libraries used as follows:
o	Numpy
o	Pandas
o	Scikit – Learn
o	Matplotlib
o	NLTK
o	WordCloud
•	ML Algorithms used are:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier

Result:
In this project, modeling process was consist of vectorizing the corpus stored in the “text” column, then applying TF-IDF, and finally a classification machine learning algorithm. After analyzing all three models’ performance, we have come to the conclusion that Decision Tree Classifier model has shown the highest accuracy (99.57%) for our dataset. That means this classification model / algorithm can detect fake and real news with 99.57% accuracy.
