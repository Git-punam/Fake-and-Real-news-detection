Dataset link:
Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
). There are two files, one for real news and one for fake news (both in English) with a total of 23481 “fake” tweets and 21417 “real” articles.

**OBJECTIVE:**

To analyze three different Machine Learning Classification algorithms / models on ‘Fake and real news’ dataset and select the model which gives us the highest performance to detect fake and real news.

•	Python libraries used as follows:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit – Learn
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
- WordCloud

•	ML Algorithms used are:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

**RESULT:**

In this project, modeling process was consist of vectorizing the corpus stored in the “text” column, then applying TF-IDF, and finally a classification machine learning algorithm. After analyzing all three models’ performance, we have come to the conclusion that Decision Tree Classifier model has shown the highest accuracy (99.57%) for our dataset. That means this classification model / algorithm can detect fake and real news with 99.57% accuracy.
